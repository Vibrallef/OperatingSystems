Memory Management- Manages primary/ Main memory, that being a large array of words and bytes, each with it's own address. Decides when and how much memory a process will recieve. It also re-allocates that memory from a process that has been terminated or no longer needs it.
Processor Management- decides when and for how long a process gets a processor which is called process scheduling. Keeps track of processors and status of process with the program called traffic control. Much like Memory Management it re-allocates the processors when not in use.
